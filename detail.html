(Verse 1)
In the rhythm of the heart, in the whisper of the wind,
In the silence of the stars, where our journey begins.
Through the highs and the lows, through the joy and the pain,
In the dance of life, we find our refrain.

(Chorus)
Eternal Harmony, a symphony of souls,
A melody that binds us, a rhythm that unfolds.
In every note, in every sound,
In the silence between, where peace is found.

(Verse 2)
Through the laughter and the tears, through the hopes and the fears,
In the symphony of life, our music appears.
With each beat of the heart, with each breath we take,
We compose our song, with every choice we make.

(Chorus)
Eternal Harmony, a symphony of life,
A melody of love, cutting through strife.
In every note, in every sound,
In the silence between, where truth is found.

(Bridge)
In the rhythm of the heart, in the whisper of the wind,
In the silence of the stars, our harmony begins.
Through the dance of life, through the song we share,
In Eternal Harmony, we find we care.

(Chorus)
Eternal Harmony, a symphony of dreams,
A melody of moments, flowing like streams.
In every note, in every sound,
In the silence between, where love is found.

(Outro)
In the rhythm of the heart, in the whisper of the wind,
In the silence of the stars, our harmony begins.
Eternal Harmony, our song takes flight,
In the symphony of life, we find our light.
