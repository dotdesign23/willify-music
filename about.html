			<h3 class="about-title">Histoy of Willify</h3>
			<p class="about-description">Willify was born out of a passion for music and a desire to give power back to the listeners. Founded in 2024 by music enthusiasts and tech innovators, Will Smith and Wilfred Lee, Willify started as a small project in a garage in San Francisco.</p>
			<p class="about-description">The founders, frustrated by the lack of personalization and control in existing music streaming platforms, envisioned a platform where users could not only discover new music but also shape their own playlists according to their will. Hence, the name 'Willify' was coined, combining 'Will' and 'amplify'.
			<p class="about-description">In its early days, Willify faced numerous challenges. The music industry was dominated by giants, and securing licensing agreements was a daunting task. However, the founders' relentless determination and unique vision gradually won over artists and record labels.</p>
			<p class="about-description">By 2025, Willify launched its beta version, which was met with enthusiasm from early adopters. Its user-centric approach, combined with a sophisticated recommendation algorithm, set it apart from competitors. Users loved the freedom and control they had over their music, and Willify quickly gained popularity.</p>
			<p class="about-description">In 2026, Willify secured a series of investments that allowed it to expand its catalogue and improve its technology. It introduced innovative features like mood-based playlists, AI-generated songs, and social listening experiences, further enhancing its user experience.</p>
			<p class="about-description">Today, Willify stands as a testament to the power of user choice and innovation. With millions of songs and users worldwide, it continues to shape the future of music streaming, staying true to its tagline: 'Your Will, Your Playlist!</p>
